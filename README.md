This layout allows a client to communicate to a team what type of behavior they are looking for and allow the developer team to think up a solution that best fits the clients need.

The development team will then create sub-bullets called Feature Tasks which are individual tasks that must be completed by the developer to accomplish the user story. Once all of the feature tasks for an individual user story is completed, so is the story.

Below are your lab requirements in this format. Try and think up what the feature tasks would be for each story, once your done, or you get stuck, review the provided feature tasks to see what the actual tasks are for each story.
